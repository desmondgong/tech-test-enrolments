## Getting started
### Tech Stack
This application is based on the following tools/libraries:
- UI Render: **Dojo 1.14.1**.
- Web Server: **Express**.

### Setup
1. Clone the project from Git repo.
2. Make sure you have node installed (install Node.js LTS v6.X.X, NPM 3.X).
3. Switch to top level directory.
4. `npm install` (Install necessary npm packages).
5. `npm start` to start web server.
6. Go to browser and hit http://localhost:3000 to launch.

_Notice: This app uses **Mock API** to process all functions, neither backend service nor database is connected. So all actions will not affect the pages, but you can check the network to see whether the logic is correct or not._
